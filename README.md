# essential_r_packages

This repository simply stores convienent scripts to run when I download a new version of R. I prefer this option to the path offered by the installr package available on CRAN as it allows me to completely remove past versions of R (to avoid any version conflicts). 

The idea is to simply run the relevant portions of this script once you have installed a new version of R. Changes will be made based on my current research and teaching needs.
